# Scoring Rubric: Detailed 0-100 Guide Per Dimension

## Market Demand (0-100)

| Score | Description | Signals |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0-20 | No visible demand | No Reddit/forum discussions, no search signals, users seem satisfied |
| 21-40 | Minimal demand | Few scattered complaints, small niche, <1K community members |
| 41-60 | Moderate demand | Regular forum discussions, 1-10K community, some users seeking solutions |
| 61-80 | Strong demand | Active communities 10K+, frequent pain point posts, users actively searching for tools |
| 81-100 | Exceptional demand | Massive unmet need, 50K+ community, daily pain point discussions, users willing to pay |

**Scoring adjustments**:
- +10 per strong demand signal (high-engagement post, multiple sources confirming)
- +5 per moderate demand signal
- +5 if community size > 10K relevant users
- +10 if pain point severity > 80 identified
- -10 if no demand signals found despite searching
- -15 if market appears fully satisfied with existing solutions

## Competitive Landscape (0-100, higher = more favorable)

| Score | Description | Signals |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0-20 | Saturated market | Multiple well-funded incumbents, little room for new entrant |
| 21-40 | Crowded | Several competitors, some differentiation possible but difficult |
| 41-60 | Competitive | Existing tools but with notable gaps, room for better solution |
| 61-80 | Favorable | Few competitors, significant feature gaps, clear differentiation path |
| 81-100 | Blue ocean | No direct competitors, first-mover opportunity, massive gaps |

**Scoring adjustments**:
- +15 if no direct competitors found
- +10 per significant gap identified in existing tools
- -10 per strong incumbent (>$10M funding or >10K users)
- -5 per well-funded new entrant
- +10 if market is nascent/growing phase
- -15 if market is mature/saturated

## Financial Viability (0-100)

| Score | Description | Signals |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0-20 | Not viable | TAM < $10M, users won't pay, high costs |
| 21-40 | Marginal | TAM $10-50M, low ARPU (<$10/mo), slow path to revenue |
| 41-60 | Moderate | TAM $50-200M, reasonable ARPU ($10-30/mo), break-even in 6-12 months |
| 61-80 | Strong | TAM $200M-1B, good ARPU ($30-50/mo), break-even in 3-6 months |
| 81-100 | Excellent | TAM > $1B, high ARPU ($50+/mo), break-even < 3 months |

**Scoring adjustments**:
- +15 if TAM > $100M
- +10 if ARPU > $30/mo
- +10 if break-even < 6 months
- +5 if low infrastructure costs (<$100/mo)
- -10 if dependent on expensive paid APIs
- -15 if conversion assumptions are aggressive (>10% free-to-paid assumed)

## Execution Feasibility (0-100)

| Score | Description | Signals |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0-20 | Enterprise only | Requires team of 5+, proprietary tech, regulatory compliance |
| 21-40 | Small team | 2-3 people needed, some specialized skills required |
| 41-60 | Challenging solo | Possible alone but MVP > 8 weeks, some skills gaps |
| 61-80 | Solo-friendly | MVP in 4-8 weeks, standard tech stack, manageable maintenance |
| 81-100 | Ideal for solo | MVP in 2-4 weeks, familiar stack, low maintenance, no platform dependencies |

**Scoring adjustments**:
- +20 if achievable solo (complete MVP alone)
- +10 if MVP < 6 weeks
- +5 if standard tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind)
- -15 if requires proprietary API access
- -10 if heavy ongoing maintenance (>15 hrs/week)
- -10 if requires skills gap training (>2 weeks learning)

## Risk Assessment (0-100, higher = lower risk)

| Score | Description | Signals |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0-20 | Very high risk | Multiple critical kill criteria, platform could shut you down |
| 21-40 | High risk | 1+ critical risks, weak mitigations, no historical success precedent |
| 41-60 | Moderate risk | Some high risks but mitigable, mixed historical precedent |
| 61-80 | Manageable risk | Low-to-medium risks, good mitigations, favorable precedents |
| 81-100 | Low risk | No critical risks, strong mitigations, proven market model |

**Scoring adjustments**:
- Start at 80 (assume manageable until proven otherwise)
- -15 per critical kill criteria identified
- -8 per high-severity risk
- -3 per medium-severity risk
- +5 per viable mitigation strategy documented
- +5 if historical analogies show success in similar ventures

# Scoring Rubric — Examples

## High-Scoring Idea (BUILD_NOW, 85+)

**Example: "AI-Powered Client Proposal Generator"**

**Personal Utility: 92**
- Solves real pain (95): Used weekly across multiple client projects
- Domain match (90): Directly leverages SMB consulting and AI experience
- Tech stack (95): Next.js + Claude API + Supabase — exact match
- Portfolio synergy (88): Extends prospecting-export plugin, feeds into project-init

**Marketization: 85**
- Market demand (88): Abundant complaints about proposal writing time on Reddit, Indie Hackers
- Pathway clarity (90): Clear SaaS with tiered pricing — solo/$29, team/$79, agency/$199
- Willingness to pay (82): Saves 3-5 hours per proposal, directly tied to revenue
- Competitive landscape (78): Proposify and PandaDoc exist but no AI-native, no Claude integration

**Novelty: 78**
- Originality (75): Proposal tools exist but no Claude Code plugin for this
- AI-native advantage (85): AI writes drafts from project context — impossible without LLM
- Trend alignment (72): AI writing tools are mainstream, but plugin-first approach is novel

**Composite: (92 * 0.40) + (85 * 0.35) + (78 * 0.25) = 36.8 + 29.75 + 19.5 = 86.05**
**Tier: BUILD_NOW**

## Medium-Scoring Idea (STRONG, 65-79)

**Example: "Plugin Usage Analytics Dashboard"**

**Personal Utility: 78**
- Solves real pain (70): Useful monthly, not daily — nice to know which plugins get used
- Domain match (75): Adjacent to existing plugin-dev work
- Tech stack (90): Next.js dashboard, reads local files — exact match
- Portfolio synergy (80): Benefits entire plugin portfolio but doesn't extend any specific one

**Marketization: 62**
- Market demand (55): Some interest in Claude Code analytics but small community
- Pathway clarity (70): Could be a SaaS for plugin marketplace operators
- Willingness to pay (55): Modest — analytics is a "nice to have" for most builders
- Competitive landscape (72): Nothing exists yet, but small TAM

**Novelty: 70**
- Originality (80): First plugin analytics tool for Claude Code ecosystem
- AI-native advantage (55): AI optional — could be built without AI
- Trend alignment (75): Claude Code ecosystem is growing, early mover advantage

**Composite: (78 * 0.40) + (62 * 0.35) + (70 * 0.25) = 31.2 + 21.7 + 17.5 = 70.4**
**Tier: STRONG**

## Low-Scoring Idea (PASS, <50)

**Example: "AI Recipe Recommendation Plugin"**

**Personal Utility: 25**
- Solves real pain (15): Not a pain point for this operator
- Domain match (10): Zero overlap with SMB/AI SaaS expertise
- Tech stack (60): Could use Claude API but why?
- Portfolio synergy (5): Completely isolated from existing portfolio

**Marketization: 55**
- Market demand (65): Recipe apps have demand but saturated
- Pathway clarity (50): Could be a mobile app but that's not the operator's strength
- Willingness to pay (45): Recipe apps compete with free alternatives
- Competitive landscape (25): Extremely saturated — Yummly, Paprika, hundreds more

**Novelty: 30**
- Originality (20): Many recipe AI tools already exist
- AI-native advantage (40): AI can help with recipe generation, but it's incremental
- Trend alignment (30): Not riding any new wave

**Composite: (25 * 0.40) + (55 * 0.35) + (30 * 0.25) = 10 + 19.25 + 7.5 = 36.75**
**Tier: PASS**

## Scoring Calibration Notes

### Personal Utility Anchors
- **90+**: "I would use this EVERY DAY and it directly impacts my revenue or productivity"
- **70-89**: "I'd use this weekly, it saves real time on tasks I already do"
- **50-69**: "I'd use this occasionally, nice to have but not essential"
- **30-49**: "I might use it once in a while, it's adjacent to what I do"
- **<30**: "This doesn't solve any problem I have"

### Marketization Anchors
- **90+**: "This is a clear SaaS with obvious pricing, proven demand, and weak competition"
- **70-89**: "Good product potential with some demand signals, clear but competitive market"
- **50-69**: "Could be productized but demand is uncertain or market is crowded"
- **30-49**: "Hard to see a business model, niche audience, or saturated market"
- **<30**: "No clear path to revenue, or fundamentally unsuitable as a product"

### Novelty Anchors
- **90+**: "Nothing like this exists anywhere, leverages brand-new AI capabilities"
- **70-89**: "Novel approach or first-in-category for this ecosystem"
- **50-69**: "Derivative but differentiated, or uses AI in a modestly novel way"
- **30-49**: "Incremental improvement on existing tools"
- **<30**: "Clone of existing tool with no meaningful differentiation"

### Portfolio Synergy Scoring
- **90-100**: Natural extension of existing plugin (like finder extending recommender)
- **70-89**: Fills a documented gap in the portfolio (uncovered domain)
- **50-69**: Standalone but could share data/infrastructure with existing plugins
- **30-49**: Loosely related to existing work
- **0-29**: Completely isolated, no connection to portfolio

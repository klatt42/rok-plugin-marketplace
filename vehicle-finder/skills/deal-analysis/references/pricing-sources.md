2. **Use site: operator** to target specific aggregators
3. **Include price cap** in queries: `under $38,000` or `"$35,000"`
4. **Try both model names**: `RAV4 Hybrid` and `RAV4-Hybrid`
5. **Include condition**: `new` or `used` or `certified pre-owned`
6. **Add trim for precision**: `"XLE Premium"` in quotes
7. **Use current year**: Always include year to avoid stale results

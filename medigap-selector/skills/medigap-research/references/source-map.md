## Source Quality Rules

1. **Government sources (CMS, state DOI)**: Highest trust. Use as primary.
2. **Rating agencies (AM Best, NAIC)**: High trust for financial/complaint data.
3. **Independent research (KFF, MedPAC)**: High trust for analysis and statistics.
4. **Broker sites**: Useful for current premiums but may have sales bias. Cross-reference with 2+ sources.
5. **Forum posts / anecdotes**: Lowest trust. Use only for directional insights, never as sole source.

## Cross-Reference Requirements

- Premium data: Require 2+ sources per insurer
- Complaint ratios: NAIC is the gold standard
- Financial strength: AM Best is the gold standard
- State rules: Verify against state DOI official publications
- Excess charge prevalence: CMS data preferred, KFF reports acceptable

## Maryland Birthday Rule — In Depth

Maryland is one of a handful of states with a "birthday rule" that gives Medigap policyholders an annual open enrollment window.

### How It Works

1. **Window**: 30 days starting on your birthday each year
2. **Underwriting**: NONE required — guaranteed issue
3. **What you can do**: Switch to any Medigap plan with EQUAL OR LESSER benefits from any insurer
4. **Pre-existing conditions**: Cannot be applied during birthday rule switching
5. **Premium**: New insurer sets your premium at their standard rate for your age

### Key Rules

- You can switch from Plan G to Plan N (lesser benefits) — YES
- You can switch from Plan N to Plan G (greater benefits) — **NO** (without underwriting)
- You can switch from Insurer A Plan G to Insurer B Plan G (equal benefits) — YES
- The birthday rule does NOT apply to Medicare Advantage plans — only Medigap

### Strategic Implications for MD Residents

**Start with Plan G, switch to Plan N later when comfortable.**

This is the most powerful strategy available to Maryland residents:

1. Enroll in Plan G during initial open enrollment (guaranteed issue, best rates)
2. Use Plan G for 1-2 years to understand your medical usage patterns
3. If you have few office visits and all providers accept assignment:
   - Use your birthday rule window to switch to Plan N
   - Save $30-$60/month with confidence
4. If you later regret switching to N:
   - You CANNOT easily switch back to G (would require underwriting)
   - This is the one risk of the strategy

## Pennsylvania — No Birthday Rule

Pennsylvania follows federal Medigap rules only. There is no state-level birthday rule or annual open enrollment for Medigap switching.

### What This Means

1. **Initial open enrollment (6 months)**: This is your ONE guaranteed opportunity to enroll in any Medigap plan at standard rates without health questions
2. **After open enrollment**: Switching requires medical underwriting
3. **Health conditions**: Any health issue developed after initial enrollment can result in denial or higher premiums when trying to switch
4. **Practical effect**: Your initial Medigap choice is effectively permanent for most people

### Federal Guaranteed Issue Rights (Apply to Both States)

You get guaranteed issue rights (no underwriting, no pre-existing condition exclusions) if:

1. Your Medicare Advantage plan leaves your area or stops participating
2. Your employer group coverage ends
3. Your Medigap insurer goes bankrupt or commits fraud
4. You left a Medigap plan to try Medicare Advantage for the first time AND want to switch back within 12 months ("trial right")
5. You were misled into dropping Medigap

## Strategic Recommendation Matrix

| Scenario | Maryland | Pennsylvania |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Risk-averse, budget secondary | Plan G (can always switch to N later) | Plan G (locked in, maximum protection) |
| Budget-conscious, healthy | Plan G initially, switch to N via birthday rule after 1-2 years | Plan N (if confident in low usage and assignment acceptance) |
| Heavy medical user | Plan G (stay with it) | Plan G (locked in protection) |
| Uncertain about usage | Plan G (safe default, birthday rule provides escape hatch) | Plan G (safer default since switching is hard) |
| All providers accept assignment | Plan N (excess charges moot) OR Plan G with future N switch | Plan N (if truly confident, since switching back is hard) |

## The Bottom Line

**Maryland**: The birthday rule makes Plan G the near-universal correct initial choice. You can always switch down to N but can't easily switch back up to G. Start safe.

**Pennsylvania**: Your initial choice matters far more. Carefully evaluate your medical usage, provider assignment rates, and risk tolerance before choosing. Switching later requires passing underwriting.

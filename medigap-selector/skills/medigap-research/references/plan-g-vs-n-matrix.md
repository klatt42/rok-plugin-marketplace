# Plan G vs Plan N Coverage Comparison Matrix

## Standardized Benefits (2026)

All Medigap plans are standardized by CMS. Plan G is Plan G regardless of insurer — the only difference between insurers is premium, customer service, and financial stability.

| Benefit | Plan G | Plan N | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Part A hospital coinsurance + 365 extra days | YES | YES | Identical |
| Part B coinsurance (general) | YES | YES (with copays) | Key difference below |
| Part B coinsurance — office visit | $0 copay | **$20 copay** | N charges up to $20/visit |
| Part B coinsurance — ER (non-admit) | $0 copay | **$50 copay** | N charges up to $50 if not admitted |
| Part B excess charges | **COVERED** | **NOT COVERED** | Critical difference |
| Blood (first 3 pints) | YES | YES | Identical |
| Part A hospice care coinsurance | YES | YES | Identical |
| Skilled nursing facility coinsurance | YES | YES | Identical |
| Part A deductible ($1,676 in 2026) | YES | YES | Identical |
| Part B deductible ($283 in 2026) | **NO** | **NO** | Neither plan covers this |
| Foreign travel emergency (80%) | YES | YES | Identical |

## Part B Excess Charges Explained

When a doctor does NOT accept Medicare assignment, they can charge up to **15% more** than the Medicare-approved amount. This 15% overage is called an "excess charge."

**Example**: Medicare approves $1,000 for a procedure. A non-participating doctor can charge up to $1,150. The $150 excess charge:
- **Plan G**: Covered — you pay $0
- **Plan N**: NOT covered — you pay $150 out of pocket

**Real-world impact**: Most doctors (96%+) accept Medicare assignment. But specialists (orthopedic surgeons, dermatologists) and out-of-area providers are less likely to participate.

## Plan F Context

Plan F (the "Cadillac plan") covered everything Plan G covers PLUS the Part B deductible ($283/year). **Plan F is closed to new enrollees as of January 1, 2020.** Anyone who became eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020 can still enroll in Plan F.

Plan G is now the most comprehensive Medigap plan available to new enrollees.

## The Real Difference: G vs N

The G-vs-N decision comes down to three variables:

1. **Premium savings**: Plan N is typically $30-$60/month cheaper than Plan G
2. **Office visit frequency**: At $20/copay, break-even is ~18-30 visits/year depending on premium spread
3. **Excess charge exposure**: If ALL your doctors accept assignment, excess charge coverage has zero value

## Historical Premium Trends

- Plan G premiums have risen 3-6% annually in most states
- Plan N premiums have risen 2-5% annually (slightly slower due to cost-sharing)
- The premium gap between G and N tends to WIDEN over time as Plan G attracts higher utilizers
- Issue-age rated policies lock in lower rates at younger enrollment ages
- Attained-age rated policies increase with age regardless of when you enrolled

## Key Deductibles and Out-of-Pocket for 2026

| Item | Amount | Who Pays |
|------|--------|----------|
| Part A deductible | $1,676 | Covered by both G and N |
| Part B deductible | $283 | **You pay** (neither G nor N covers this) |
| Part B excess charges | Up to 15% over approved | G covers, N does not |
| Plan N office copay | Up to $20 | N enrollees pay per visit |
| Plan N ER copay (non-admit) | Up to $50 | N enrollees pay per ER visit not resulting in admission |

# Contractor Intelligence

## Prism Specialties DMV Context (for Contractor Relationships)

**Company**: Prism Specialties DMV
**Services**: Contents restoration, electronics restoration, art/document restoration, textile restoration, structural drying, large loss contents pack-out
**Territory**: Washington DC, Northern Virginia, Maryland

**Value Proposition for Contractors**:
Prism handles the specialty contents work that general contractors and restoration contractors don't do. When a GC or mitigation company is on a fire, water, or smoke loss, they handle the structure — Prism handles the contents. This makes the contractor look good to the adjuster, the policyholder gets better service, and the contractor doesn't need to invest in specialty equipment or training.

**Why Contractors Refer to Prism**:
- Contractors keep their structural scope; Prism handles contents only (no scope competition)
- Prism's documentation helps the contractor's overall claim get approved faster
- Detailed inventory reports protect the contractor from disputes about missing/damaged items
- Electronics restoration saves expensive equipment that would otherwise be a replacement line item
- Art and document recovery capabilities most contractors can't offer
- Pack-out services free up the job site for structural work to begin sooner

## Referral Relationship Dynamics

### How Contractor Referrals Work

```
Loss Event (fire, water, storm)
  -> Policyholder or adjuster calls restoration/GC
    -> Contractor arrives, assesses structural scope
      -> Contractor sees contents needing specialty work
        -> Contractor calls Prism for contents scope
          -> Prism and contractor coordinate on-site
            -> Prism handles contents, contractor handles structure
              -> Both invoice carrier (separate scopes)
                -> Adjuster closes claim with complete documentation
```

### What Makes a Good Referral Partner

1. **Volume**: Handles 5+ insurance losses per month
2. **Territory overlap**: Works in Prism's service area (DC, NoVA, MD)
3. **Loss types**: Fire, water, and smoke losses (contents always involved)
4. **No contents capability**: Doesn't have in-house contents restoration
5. **Carrier relationships**: Works with carriers Prism also targets
6. **Professionalism**: Good reputation, licensed, insured, responsive
7. **Communication style**: Coordinates well, shares job information

### Referral Incentives (What Prism Offers)

- **Reciprocal referrals**: Prism refers structural work back to the contractor
- **Faster claim closure**: Prism's documentation helps the overall claim move faster
- **No scope competition**: Prism only does contents, never competes for structural work

## DMV Geography (Contractor Focus)

### High-Priority Areas (Most Insurance Losses)

| Area | Why High Priority | Key Contractor Presence |
|------|------------------|------------------------|
| Fairfax County | Largest NoVA county, aging housing stock, affluent | Many SERVPRO/ServiceMaster franchises |
| Montgomery County MD | Affluent, older homes, water damage common | Strong independent contractor market |
| Prince George's County MD | High volume, dense housing, flood-prone areas | Mix of franchise and independent |
| Arlington/Alexandria | Dense urban, condos, commercial properties | Fewer but high-value contractors |
| DC Proper | Government, historic, commercial properties | Specialty contractors for historic |
| Loudoun County | Fast-growing, new construction, storm exposure | Growing contractor market |
| Howard/Anne Arundel MD | Suburban, waterfront (AA), good income levels | Established contractor networks |

### Storm/Weather Patterns Driving Losses

- **Hurricane season** (June-November): Wind, water, flooding — biggest loss events
- **Winter storms** (December-March): Pipe bursts, ice dams, roof collapse
- **Summer storms** (May-September): Severe thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes (rare)
- **Flooding**: Flash floods in low-lying DC areas, Ellicott City historically

## Outreach Best Practices (for Contractors)

### Positioning

- **Lead with partnership**: "We handle contents so you can focus on structure"
- **No competition**: "We never do structural work — your scope stays yours"
- **Make them look good**: "Our documentation helps your entire claim get approved faster"
- **Easy to work with**: "Call us, we show up, we coordinate, we document everything"

### Channel Priority

1. **Job site introduction**: Meet at an active loss where both are working — highest conversion
2. **Warm introduction** (through adjuster, agent, or mutual contractor) — strong trust
3. **Industry event networking** (RIA, IICRC, ABC meetings) — professional context
4. **LinkedIn** (connection request + message) — good for initial contact
5. **Email/phone** (from website or license lookup) — direct but lower response
6. **Drop-in visit** (contractor office with capability sheet) — old school but effective

### Timing

- **After a major storm**: Contractors are overwhelmed, need reliable partners NOW
- **Before storm season** (March-April): Establish partnership before peak
- **After a successful joint job**: Ask for referrals to their network
- **At CE events**: Natural networking environment
- **When they win a preferred vendor contract**: They'll need subcontractors

## Pipeline Stages

| Meeting/Visit Done | Met in person or virtual | Send capability sheet, discuss partnership |
| Active Partner | Has referred or agreed to refer work | Maintain with periodic check-ins |
| Dormant | Was active but referrals stopped | Re-engage with recent project update |

## Who to Contact Within a Contractor Organization

| Role | Why | Priority |
|------|-----|----------|
| Owner / President | Decision maker for partnerships | HIGH |
| Operations Manager | Controls which subs get called | HIGH |
| Estimator / Project Manager | On-site, sees contents needs firsthand | HIGH |

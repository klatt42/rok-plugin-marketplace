# Contractor Outreach

You are drafting personalized outreach messages to a contractor on behalf of Prism Specialties DMV. The goal is to establish a referral partnership — not make a hard sell. Contractors are potential partners, not customers.

## Input

The user will provide:
- **Company name or contact name** (required)
- **Context** from a previous `/contractor-prospecting:contractor-profile` (ideal) or basic info (type, location, services)
- **Channel preference** (LinkedIn, email, phone script, in-person intro) — if not specified, draft all

## Prism Context (Use in All Messages)

**Company**: Prism Specialties DMV
**What we do**: Specialty contents restoration — electronics, documents, art, textiles, and structural drying
**Value to contractors**: We handle the contents side so you can focus on structure. No scope competition — we complement your work, never compete with it. Our documentation helps the entire claim get approved faster.
**Credibility**: IICRC-certified, photo documentation before/during/after, detailed inventory reports
**Territory**: DC, Northern Virginia, Maryland
**Tone**: Professional, collegial, partnership-oriented. Position as a teammate, not a vendor. We're the specialty partner they can count on when contents are involved in a loss.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify the Best Hook

Choose the strongest hook based on available context (in priority order):
1. **Recent shared job site**: "I noticed we were both at the [location] loss last week"
2. **Mutual connection**: "I saw we both know [person] — they suggested I reach out"
3. **Shared carrier**: "I know you do work for [carrier] — so do we, on the contents side"
4. **Shared territory**: "We both cover [county/area] — makes sense to know each other"
5. **Their service gap**: "I noticed you handle [structural work] but not contents — that's exactly what we do"
6. **Industry event**: "I'll be at [RIA/IICRC/ABC event] — would love to connect"
7. **Complementary services**: "Your mitigation work and our contents restoration pair well together"

### Step 2: Draft Messages

#### LinkedIn Connection Request (300 character max)
```
Hi [First Name], I run the contents restoration team at Prism Specialties DMV. [One-sentence hook]. I'd love to connect — always good to know the specialty partners in your area.
```

#### LinkedIn Follow-Up Message (after connection accepted)
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]. [Expand on hook — 2-3 sentences].

At Prism, we handle the specialty contents side of property losses — electronics, documents, art, textiles. When your team is on a fire or water loss with significant contents, we come in and handle that scope so you can focus on the structural work.

The nice thing is there's zero overlap — we only do contents, you do the structure. It's a clean partnership that makes the whole claim go smoother.

Would you be open to a quick call or coffee sometime? I'd like to learn about your operation and share how we can be a resource when contents come up on your jobs.

#### Email Introduction

Subject: Contents Restoration Partner for [Their Territory/Company] Jobs

Hi [First Name],

[Hook paragraph — why you're reaching out, specific to their company].

I'm [name] with Prism Specialties DMV. We specialize in contents restoration for insurance losses — electronics, documents, art, textiles, and structural drying. When your team is on a fire, water, or smoke loss with contents involvement, we handle that specialty scope.

How it works with our contractor partners:
- You handle the structure, we handle the contents — zero scope overlap
- Our detailed photo inventory and documentation helps the entire claim get approved faster
- We coordinate with your team on-site so the job flows smoothly
- IICRC-certified technicians, fast response across DC, NoVA, and Maryland

Several restoration contractors in the area bring us in on their larger losses. It's been a good partnership model — they keep their structural scope, we add a service their clients need, and the adjuster gets a cleaner claim file.

Would you be open to a brief call or meeting? I'd love to learn about your operation and discuss how we could work together when contents come up on your jobs.

Best regards,
[Name]
Prism Specialties DMV

#### Phone Script (Cold Call or Warm)
```
Hi [First Name], this is [name] with Prism Specialties DMV. Do you have a quick minute?

[If yes]:
Great — I'll keep it brief. We're a specialty contents restoration company here in the DMV. We handle things like electronics, documents, art, and textiles on insurance losses.

The reason I'm calling is that a lot of the restoration contractors and GCs we work with bring us in on their fire and water losses when there are contents involved. We handle that specialty scope so they can focus on the structure.

I wanted to see if that's something you'd be interested in exploring. No pressure — I'd just like to get on your radar for when a loss comes up with significant contents.

[If interested]: Could we set up a quick meeting or coffee? I'd love to learn about your operation.

[If not now]: Totally understand. Can I send you our capability sheet so you have our info for the future?
```

#### In-Person Introduction (at event or site visit)
```
Hi, I'm [name] with Prism Specialties DMV. [Handshake]

We do specialty contents restoration — electronics, documents, art, textiles. When [contractors like you / restoration companies] are on a fire or water loss with contents involved, we come in and handle that scope.

[Hook — reference to event, shared territory, or how you heard of them]

The partnership works well because there's no overlap — we only touch contents, never compete on structure. And our documentation helps the whole claim get approved faster.

I'd love to learn more about your operation. Can I grab your card and follow up with a call next week?
```

### Step 3: Follow-Up Sequence

```
## Follow-Up Plan for [Company/Contact Name]

**Day 0**: Send initial outreach ([channel])
**Day 3-5**: If no response — engage on LinkedIn (like their posts, comment on project photos)
**Day 7**: Follow-up message:
  "Hi [First Name], just circling back on my note from last week. We've been getting good traction partnering with [contractor type] in [their area] on insurance losses. If contents restoration ever comes up on one of your jobs, I'd love to be a resource. No pressure — just want to make sure you have our info."
**Day 14**: Final follow-up:
  "Hi [First Name], last note from me for now. If your team ever runs into a loss with significant contents — electronics, documents, art — feel free to reach out. We're always happy to take a look and give you a scope assessment. [Phone/email]"
**Day 30+**: If no response — add to quarterly check-in list. Re-engage after a storm event or when you're both at an industry event.
**After a successful joint job**: Ask for introductions to their network — "Who else in your circle handles insurance work? I'd love to connect with them too."
```

### Step 4: Update Pipeline

After drafting, suggest:
"Update the pipeline: run `/contractor-prospecting:pipeline-status` and move [name] to 'Outreach Sent' stage."

## Rules

- **Never lie or fabricate connections** — if there's no mutual connection, don't pretend there is
- **Plain text only** for emails — no markdown formatting (bold, italic, bullets with asterisks). Use dashes for lists.
- **Keep LinkedIn connection requests under 300 characters**
- **Partnership language, not sales language** — avoid "We're the best", "You need us", "industry leader"
- **Be specific** — reference their company, territory, contractor type, or services. Generic messages get ignored.
- **One CTA per message** — don't ask for a call AND a referral AND a meeting in the same message
- **Professional but human** — contractors are busy, practical people. Be direct and clear about the mutual benefit.
- **Emphasize no scope competition** — this is the #1 concern contractors have about bringing in another company

### Independent Adjusting Firms (handle overflow for carriers)

- Crawford & Company

## Adjuster Hierarchy

```
Claims VP / Regional Director
  └── Claims Manager (oversees territory/office)
      └── Team Lead / Supervisor (manages 5-10 adjusters)
          └── Senior Field Adjuster (handles complex/large losses)
          └── Field Adjuster (standard property claims)
          └── Desk Adjuster (remote claims handling)
          └── Catastrophe Adjuster (deployed for storms/events)
```

**Who to target**:
- **Field Adjusters**: Primary contact — they're on-site at losses, decide who to call for restoration
- **Team Leads**: Influence multiple adjusters, can recommend Prism to their team
- **Claims Managers**: Can establish preferred vendor relationships
- **CAT Adjusters**: Temporary but high-volume during storm season

## Search Strategies

### LinkedIn Boolean Searches

**Basic adjuster search**:
```
("claims adjuster" OR "property adjuster" OR "field adjuster" OR "senior adjuster")
AND ("State Farm" OR "Allstate" OR "Travelers" OR [carrier name])
AND ("Washington" OR "Virginia" OR "Maryland" OR "DMV")
```

**Large loss / specialty**:
```
("large loss adjuster" OR "complex claims" OR "commercial adjuster")
AND ("Washington DC" OR "Northern Virginia" OR "Maryland")
```

**Independent adjusting firms**:
```
("Crawford" OR "Sedgwick" OR "McLarens" OR "Engle Martin")
AND ("adjuster" OR "examiner" OR "claims")
AND ("DC" OR "Virginia" OR "Maryland")
```

**Team leads and managers**:
```
("claims manager" OR "claims supervisor" OR "team lead")
AND ("property" OR "homeowners" OR "commercial property")
AND ("Washington" OR "Virginia" OR "Maryland")
```

### State DOI License Lookups

| State | URL | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Maryland | https://sbs.naic.org/solar-external-lookup/ | Search by name, license type "Adjuster" |
| Virginia | https://scc.virginia.gov/pages/Bureau-of-Insurance | Agent lookup tool |
| DC | https://disb.dc.gov/service/verify-insurance-license | License verification |

### Other Search Sources

- **Carrier websites**: Look for "Find a claims office" or local office directories
- **PLRB** (Property Loss Research Bureau): Industry conference attendee lists
- **RIA** (Restoration Industry Association): Member directories, event attendees
- **C&R Magazine**: Industry publication, contributor lists
- **Local BOMA chapters**: Building Owners and Managers Association events
- **LinkedIn Groups**: "Insurance Claims Professionals", "Property Claims Adjusters", carrier-specific alumni groups
- **Google**: "[carrier name] claims office [city]", "[adjuster name] insurance adjuster"

## Outreach Best Practices

### Positioning (for adjusters)
- **Lead with value**: "I help adjusters close contents claims faster with documented restoration"
- **Not salesy**: Position as a resource, not a vendor pushing services
- **Specificity matters**: Reference their carrier, territory, or a recent local event
- **Credibility signals**: IICRC certifications, years in business, photo documentation process

### Channel Priority
1. **Warm introduction** (through mutual connection, agent, contractor) — highest conversion
2. **LinkedIn** (connection request + message) — professional context
3. **Email** (if found through carrier directory or DOI lookup) — direct but lower response
4. **In-person** (industry events, carrier office visits, CE classes) — highest relationship quality

### Timing
- **After a major storm/event**: Adjusters are overwhelmed, need reliable vendors NOW
- **Before storm season** (March-April): Establish relationship before they need you
- **Q1 planning**: Carriers review vendor lists in January
- **After a successful job**: Ask the adjuster for referrals to colleagues

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Definition | Next Action |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Identified | Found name/carrier/territory | Research and build profile |
| Researched | Full profile built | Draft outreach message |
| Outreach Sent | Initial contact made | Wait 3 days, then follow up |
| Connected | Accepted connection or replied | Schedule intro call/meeting |
| Meeting Scheduled | Call or in-person set | Prepare talking points |
| Active Relationship | Ongoing, has sent or could send work | Maintain with periodic check-ins |

## Claim Workflow (How Adjusters Use Restoration Companies)

```
Loss Event (fire, water, storm)
  → Policyholder files claim
    → Carrier assigns adjuster
      → Adjuster inspects loss
        → Adjuster determines scope (repair, restore, replace)
          → If contents involved: Adjuster calls restoration company
            → Restoration company provides estimate
              → Adjuster approves/negotiates scope
                → Work performed, documented, invoiced
                  → Adjuster closes claim
```

**Where Prism fits**: Step 6 — when the adjuster needs a specialty restoration company for contents, electronics, documents, or textiles. The goal is to be the adjuster's first call.

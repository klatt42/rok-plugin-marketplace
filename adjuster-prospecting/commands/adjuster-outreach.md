# Adjuster Outreach

You are drafting personalized outreach messages to an insurance adjuster on behalf of Prism Specialties DMV. The goal is to establish a professional relationship — not make a hard sell.

## Input

The user will provide:
- **Adjuster name** (required)
- **Context** from a previous `/adjuster-prospecting:adjuster-profile` (ideal) or basic info (carrier, title, territory)
- **Channel preference** (LinkedIn, email, warm intro) — if not specified, draft all three

## Prism Context (Use in All Messages)

**Company**: Prism Specialties DMV
**What we do**: Specialty contents restoration — electronics, documents, art, textiles, and structural drying
**Value to adjusters**: We help close claims faster with thorough documentation. Restoration vs. replacement saves the carrier money while keeping policyholders satisfied.
**Credibility**: IICRC-certified, photo documentation before/during/after, detailed inventory reports
**Territory**: DC, Northern Virginia, Maryland
**Tone**: Professional, helpful, knowledgeable. Position as a resource, not a vendor. We're the expert the adjuster can rely on when contents are involved.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify the Best Hook

Choose the strongest hook based on available context (in priority order):
1. **Mutual connection**: "I see we both know [person] — they suggested I reach out"
2. **Recent local event**: "After the [storm/fire/flood event] in [area], I wanted to connect"
3. **Shared territory**: "I noticed you cover [county/area] — that's our primary service area"
4. **Industry event**: "I'll be at [PLRB/RIA event] — would love to connect"
5. **Carrier relationship**: "We've worked with several [carrier] adjusters in the area"
6. **Specialization match**: "I saw you handle [loss type] claims — that's exactly where we specialize"

### Step 2: Draft Messages

#### LinkedIn Connection Request (300 character max)
```
Hi [First Name], I lead the contents restoration team at Prism Specialties DMV. [One-sentence hook]. I'd love to connect — always helpful to know the specialty restoration resources in your territory.
```

#### LinkedIn Follow-Up Message (after connection accepted)
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]. [Expand on hook — 2-3 sentences].

At Prism, we handle the contents side of property losses — electronics, documents, art, textiles. Our detailed documentation and photo inventory process helps adjusters close claims cleanly.

Would you be open to a quick call sometime? I'd love to learn about your territory and share how we can be a resource when contents are involved.

[Your name]
Prism Specialties DMV
```

#### Email Introduction
```
Subject: Contents Restoration Resource for [Territory/Carrier] Claims

Hi [First Name],

[Hook paragraph — why you're reaching out, specific to their situation].

I'm [name] with Prism Specialties DMV. We specialize in contents restoration for insurance claims — electronics, documents, art, textiles, and structural drying. When your policyholders have a fire, water, or smoke loss with significant contents involvement, we handle the specialty restoration work.

What sets us apart for adjusters:
- Detailed photo inventory (before, during, and after restoration)
- Documented restoration vs. replacement decisions that hold up to review
- IICRC-certified technicians
- Fast response across DC, Northern Virginia, and Maryland

I'd welcome the chance to introduce our team and learn about your territory. Would a brief call work sometime in the next week or two?

Best regards,
[Name]
Prism Specialties DMV
[Phone] | [Email]
```

#### Warm Introduction Request (to mutual connection)
```
Hi [Mutual Connection First Name],

I'm looking to connect with [Adjuster First Name] [Last Name] at [Carrier]. I noticed you're connected — would you be comfortable making an introduction?

We'd love to let [him/her/them] know about Prism's contents restoration services for [his/her/their] territory. No hard sell — just want to be on their radar as a resource for specialty contents claims.

Appreciate any help!
[Name]
```

### Step 3: Follow-Up Sequence

```
## Follow-Up Plan for [Adjuster Name]

**Day 0**: Send initial outreach ([channel])
**Day 3**: If no response — like/comment on their recent LinkedIn post (if applicable)
**Day 7**: Follow-up message:
  "Hi [First Name], just circling back on my note from last week. [Brief value reminder]. No pressure — just want to make sure you have our info for when a contents loss comes up in your territory."
**Day 14**: Final follow-up:
  "Hi [First Name], last note from me. If contents restoration ever comes up on a claim in [territory], we're here as a resource. Feel free to reach out anytime. [Phone/email]"
**Day 30+**: If still no response — add to quarterly check-in list. Re-engage after a local weather event or carrier news.
```

### Step 4: Update Pipeline

After drafting, suggest:
"Update the pipeline: run `/adjuster-prospecting:pipeline-status` and move [name] to 'Outreach Sent' stage."

## Rules

- **Never lie or fabricate connections** — if there's no mutual connection, don't pretend there is
- **Plain text only** for emails — no markdown formatting (bold, italic, bullets with asterisks). Use dashes for lists.
- **Keep LinkedIn connection requests under 300 characters**
- **No hard sell language** — avoid "We're the best", "You need us", "Don't miss out"
- **Be specific** — reference their carrier, territory, or loss types. Generic messages get ignored.
- **One CTA per message** — don't ask for a call AND a referral AND a meeting in the same message
- **Professional but human** — these are busy professionals who get vendor pitches constantly. Stand out by being helpful, not pushy.

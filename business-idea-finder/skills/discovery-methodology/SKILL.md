  Multi-mode business idea discovery methodology for solopreneur builders.
  Three research modes (pain point mining, gap analysis, arbitrage scanning)
  with configurable depth levels. Profile-filtered for AI-first micro-SaaS.
  Use when running /find-ideas or discussing idea discovery strategy.

## Discovery Methodology

### Three Research Modes

**Pain Point Mining**: Systematic extraction of unmet needs from online communities. Reddit is the primary signal source — real people complaining about real problems. The key is finding pain points where the current solution is "manual/spreadsheet" or "expensive enterprise tool" — these are the highest-opportunity gaps for micro-SaaS.

**Gap Analysis**: Scanning product directories and app stores for underserved categories. The strongest signal is a tool category where all options are either expensive (>$100/mo), poorly rated (<4 stars), or lack AI integration. These represent disruption opportunities for a solopreneur with AI-first development skills.

**Arbitrage Scanning**: Monitoring new AI capabilities, creator content, and emerging trends to identify things that just became possible. The arbitrage window is typically 6-12 months before established players catch up. The enabling technology must be specific — "AI" alone is not enough; it must be a particular capability (vision, agents, function calling, etc.) that unlocks a new product category.

### Depth Levels

| Depth | Time | Agents | Searches/Agent | Shortlist | Cross-Pollination |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| scan | 5-10 min | 0 (direct) | 8-12 total | 5-8 | No |
| explore | 20-40 min | 3 parallel | 8-12 each | 10 | No |
| deep-scan | 45-60 min | 3+1 | 15-20 each | 15+ | Yes |

### Signal Strength Hierarchy

1. **Triple intersection** (pain + gap + arbitrage) — Rarest, highest value
2. **Dual intersection** (any 2 modes) — Strong signal
3. **Multi-evidence single mode** — Good signal (multiple sources confirm)
4. **Single evidence** — Weakest signal, needs validation
